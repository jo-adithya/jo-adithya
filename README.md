### About me

Greetings! I'm a dedicated developer passionate about turning ideas into impactful digital experiences. My focus spans full-stack development, where I navigate both front-end elegance and back-end robustness. Join me on this exciting journey, where innovation meets efficiency.

Currently, my primary emphasis revolves around developing products and overseeing projects for EduBeyond. I find it exciting to create software combining elements of design and engineering, where the end result not only looks appealing but is also robustly constructed.

In the dynamic realm of software development, I'm committed to continuous learning. Actively staying abreast of industry trends and embracing new methodologies. Currently, I'm delving into the realm of cloud computing using AWS and learning a new language, ðŸ¦€ **Rust**.
